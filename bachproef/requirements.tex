\section{Popularity}
As it should be possible for customers to write extensions to the IAM platform, the popularity of the language in which these should be written is of great importance. Customers should be able to easily find a developer who can write in the chosen language. As discussed in the literature review, the most popular server-side programming languages are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item JavaScript
    \item Python
    \item Java
    \item TypeScript
    \item C++
    \item C\#
    \item C
    \item PHP
    \item Go
    \item Kotlin
