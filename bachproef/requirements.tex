\section{Popularity}
As it should be possible for customers to write extensions to the IAM platform, the popularity of the language in which these should be written is of great importance. Customers should be able to easily find a developer who can write in the chosen language. As discussed in the literature review, the most popular server-side programming languages are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item JavaScript
    \item Python
    \item Java
    \item TypeScript
    \item C++
    \item C\#
    \item C
    \item PHP
    \item Go
    \item Kotlin
    \item Rust
\end{itemize}

This list serves as the long list mentioned in the methodology chapter.

\section{Static Types}

\section{Performance}
% Not applicable, as network request will take up so much time that code performance costs will be negligible

\section{Readability}

\section{Final evaluation}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l| c c c |}
    \hline
    Language & Popularity & Memory safe & Statically typed \\
    \hline
    JavaScript & 62\% & Yes & No \\
    Python     & 52\% & Yes & No \\
    Java       & 40\% & Yes & Yes \\
    TypeScript & 36\% & Yes & Yes \\
    C++        & 24\% & No  & Yes \\
    C\#        & 24\% & Yes & Yes \\
    C          & 19\% & No  & Yes \\
    PHP        & 18\% & Yes & Certain aspects \\
    Go         & 15\% & Yes & Yes \\
    Kotlin     & 12\% & Yes & Yes \\
    Rust       & 12\% & Yes & Yes \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Based on this evaluation, TypeScript and Java appear to be the most promising options. In the following chapter, a proof of concept will be made in each of these languages to further compare them and their suitability.
